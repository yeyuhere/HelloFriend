# HelloFriend

This Android app enables parents with young kids nearby to share play schedule information for the current day on the map, such that kids may have opportunities to meet new friends and play together. It uses Kotlin and XML as the programming languages. User log in/log out function is implemented with Firebase Authentication. Schedule information is stored in Firebase Cloud Firestore.

Major user interface elements include a schedule page and a display page. The schedule page could be used to enter time and location, and the display page shows if there are kids nearby with marks on Google Maps. Maps SDK for Android is used to add maps to the app to use Google Maps data and display map. User could add markers to the map by adding a schedule. Geocoding API is used to convert addresses into geographic coordinates (geocoding) and reverse geocoding.
